    description: "Influential people have a profound impact on everyone they encounter. Yet, they achieve this only because they exert so much influence inside, on themselves.We see only their outside.We see them innovate, speak their mind, and propel themselves forward toward bigger and better things.And, yet, we're missing the best part.The confidence and wherewithal that make their influence possible are earned."
